# Calculator in Vanilla JS by @dtKinger

[Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) of the Fundamentals course for [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

**[Use the Calculator here](https://dtkinger.github.io/calculator-assignment-TOP/)**. It's an older model, be gentle with it and don't forget to **turn it on!**

## Unsupported things:
* Backspace keypress to last 1 digit.
* **Highlight operators on keypresses**.
